# SL-AD
A two-stage deep learning framework for detecting electromagnetic temporal anomalies associated with major earthquakes in Western China, specifically addressing severe data imbalance.
This repository is dedicated to hosting the **code** and **data processing scripts** associated with our recently published or submitted research paper.

To ensure the **completeness, clarity, and full reproducibility** of the results, our team requires a short period following the paper's official publication to finalize the **cleaning, commenting, and rigorous testing** of all code and scripts.

**We anticipate the full release of all code, environment configuration files, and data processing scripts to be completed and uploaded by [3-6 months after formal publication].**

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
